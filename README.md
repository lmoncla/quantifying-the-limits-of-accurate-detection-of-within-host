### R scripts that were used to make figures for the CA04 methods paper ###

### Contents ###

1. Figure_2_coverage_and_quality_scores.R - generates plots of average genome coverage and average quality scores

2. Figure_3_DNA_copies_impact_sensitivity.R - generates plots shown in panels a and b in Figure 3

3. Figure_3b_ROC_analyes.R - calculates sensitivity and specificity and generates plot shown in Figure 3d. 

4. Figure_4_SNP_frequency_estimates_depend_on_input_copies.R - generates all the figures shown in figure 4. 

5. Figure_5_coverage_normalization.R - generates comparisons between SNP frequencies called using original vs. normalized data. Also calculates the paired t-tests and R^2 values.

6. Figure_6_duplicate_removal.R - generates all figures shown in figure 6.
